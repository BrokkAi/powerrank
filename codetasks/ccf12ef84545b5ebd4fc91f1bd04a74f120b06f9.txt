Background  
Cassandra’s Accord journal metadata is persisted in `Metadata` objects.  
Developers need an easy-to-read textual representation of those objects, for
instance when the new stand-alone journal-dump tool prints them to the console.
Up to now `org.apache.cassandra.journal.Metadata` had no meaningful
`toString()` implementation, which makes debugging and log inspection
difficult.

Task  
Implement `Metadata.toString()` so that it returns a concise summary of the
most important fields:

• the configured `fsyncLimit`  
• the number of records already written (`recordsCount`)

The exact format used by the rest of the code base is:

"Metadata{fsyncLimit=<value>, recordsCount=<value>}"

where `<value>` is the current content of the corresponding field.  
No additional characters or whitespace should be added; the example above shows
the complete expected layout.

Constraints / Notes  
– `fsyncLimit` and `recordsCount` are already available as fields of the class  
  (no new state needs to be tracked).  
– Only public behaviour must change; do not alter the class’ serialisation
  logic or any other existing functionality.  
– All existing and new unit tests must pass.
