Implement the new “usability” safeguards that Hardened-Cassandra introduces at start-up.

Extend org.apache.cassandra.service.StartupChecks so that two additional checks are available and automatically executed by withDefaultTests():

1. checkYamlConfig  
   • Fails with a StartupException (code ERR_WRONG_CONFIG) when transient replication is enabled and the JVM is not running a unit/integration test (system property cassandra.testtag unset).  
   • Emits WARN level log lines – always suffixed with  
     “ This will impact your level of production support.” – for each of the following conditions:  
     – the configured partitioner is not Murmur3Partitioner  
     – num_tokens is higher than 16  
     – Materialized Views are enabled  
     – SASI indexes are enabled  
     – DROP COMPACT STORAGE guardrail is enabled  
     – the configured default compaction strategy is present and is not UnifiedCompactionStrategy  
     – guardrail tombstone_failure_threshold > 100 000  
     – guardrail batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb > 640  
     – the current SSTable format is not the BTI format (Trie-based)

2. checkTableSettings  
   Scans all user keyspaces and builds three separate lists of fully-qualified table names:  
   • Tables whose compaction class is SizeTieredCompactionStrategy or LeveledCompactionStrategy  
   • Tables declared WITH COMPACT STORAGE  
   • Tables that own at least one index whose implementation class is not StorageAttachedIndex  
   When any list is non-empty a single WARN line is emitted, listing the offending tables (comma-separated) and ending with the same support-impact suffix.

In addition, update existing checks:

• checkMaxMapCount’s warning must also carry the support-impact suffix.  
• checkDataDirs must warn (with suffix) when more than one data directory is configured.

All warnings produced by the new logic have to be discoverable through the normal SLF4J logging mechanism so unit tests can capture them.

The test-suite exercises:
 – Successful start-up when nothing is wrong
 – A failure for transient replication
 – Correct WARN messages for each individual guardrail
 – Table inspection logic
 – Multiple data_dir detection

Implement the described behaviour so that every provided test class passes unchanged.
