The existing Git client library already supports creating a new branch from another branch (createAndCheckoutBranch).  
A new feature is required: create a branch that starts from an arbitrary commit-id and not necessarily from the tip of an existing branch.  

Required behaviour  
1. Class src/main/java/io/github/jbellis/brokk/git/GitRepo.java must offer  
   public void createBranchFromCommit(String newBranchName, String sourceCommitId) throws GitAPIException  
   • newBranchName is the branch that will be created.  
   • sourceCommitId is any valid full or short SHA that exists in the repository.  
2. If listLocalBranches() already contains newBranchName the method must throw the same runtime exception type that the rest of the
   class uses to signal an illegal repository state (GitStateException).  
   The message is verified by the tests:  
   "Branch '" + newBranchName + "' already exists" (the calling code appends its own suffix if it wants uniqueness).  
3. Otherwise the method must ask JGit to create the branch with setStartPoint(sourceCommitId) and finally call refresh() so that the
   in-memory caches (branch list etc.) are up to date.
