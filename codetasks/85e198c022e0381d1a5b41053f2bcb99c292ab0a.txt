### Problem

The KD-tree writer in Cassandra’s Storage-Attached Index (SAI) must know the **total number of points** that will be written, **not** just the number of distinct rows.  
At the moment several components still forward a row count, which can be wrong when a single row supplies multiple
points (duplicates, tombstones, etc.).  
Your task is to update the SAI write-path so that the real point count is propagated all the way down to the
`BKDWriter`.

### What has to work

1. `BKDTreeRamBuffer` must expose the exact number of in-memory points it currently holds.
2. `NumericIndexWriter` must:
   • accept that total point count when it is created,  
   • validate it,  
   • forward it to the internal Lucene `BKDWriter` constructor.
3. All places that instantiate `NumericIndexWriter` must now pass the **point count** instead of a row count.
4. The public API should remain source-compatible wherever the method/constructor is *already* used with the
   new signature.
5. All unit tests (both the existing ones and the new ones in this change set) must pass.

### Functional requirements

• `BKDTreeRamBuffer`  
  – Add a `long numPoints()` accessor that returns the current point counter.

• `NumericIndexWriter`  
  – Constructors must replace the `int numRows` parameter with `long totalPointCount`.  
  – Reject negative values (`IllegalArgumentException`).  
  – Use that value when creating the internal `BKDWriter` (`long pointCount` constructor argument).  
  – Provide the same two public constructors as before, only differing in parameter type/name.

• Call sites  
  – Wherever `NumericIndexWriter` is created, supply the correct point count.  
  – The most important callers are `SegmentBuilder`, `MemtableIndexWriter`,
    and the various tests in `...kdtree` packages.

### Non-functional requirements

• Do not change existing semantics except for supplying the correct count.  
• Keep public APIs stable apart from the intentional signature change.  
• Ensure everything compiles with `-Xlint:all` and the whole test suite passes.

Implement these changes so that all provided tests succeed.
