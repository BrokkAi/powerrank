Background  
SAI can add per-query parameters through the WITH ann_options map.  
Until now only the integer option rerank_k was supported.  
A new boolean option use_pruning must be introduced so callers can
explicitly enable or disable the pruning heuristic that the vector
search engines (DiskANN/JVector and the in-memory graph) use to trade
off recall for latency.

Task  
1. Extend the existing ANNOptions model so that it can hold the new,
   optional flag use_pruning.  
   • Key name in CQL map: 'use_pruning'.  
   • Legal values (case-insensitive): the literals “true” or “false”.  
   • Unknown keys continue to raise InvalidRequestException.  
   • When the map is absent or the key is not present, the value in
     JVM system property cassandra.sai.jvector.use_pruning_default
     (default “true”) acts as the query’s default.

2. Parsing / validation  
   • Parsing must convert the textual value to Boolean.  
   • Validation rules of rerank_k stay unchanged.  
   • use_pruning itself does not need additional validation.

3. CQL round-trip  
   • The query formatter (toCQLString) must include use_pruning when it
     is non-null, preserving any existing rerank_k entry.

4. Transport / storage  
   • Update ANNOptions.serializer so the flag is written, read and
     sized correctly.  
   • Backwards compatibility: keep the bit-flag scheme; add one more
     bit for the new field and ignore unknown bits when *deserialising*.

5. Query execution  
   • Orderer must expose a boolean usePruning() that returns the value
     carried by ann_options when present, otherwise the JVM default.  
   • All vector searches that already receive rerankK also need the
     extra boolean parameter and must forward it to the underlying
     graph/searcher.  
   • Threshold / bounded ANN queries (the code paths used for
     “WHERE … > ? ORDER BY v ANN OF …”) must always call the same
     internal search routine with usePruning = false – i.e. these
     queries never prune.

6. Default constant  
   • Add public static boolean
     V3OnDiskFormat.JVECTOR_USE_PRUNING_DEFAULT that reads the system
     property mentioned above at class initialisation.

7. Equality / hashCode  
   • Include the new field in equals() and hashCode().

All old behaviour must remain unchanged when use_pruning is not
supplied, and every new and existing test must compile and pass.
