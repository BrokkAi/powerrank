Your task is to bring the build back to green.

The test-suite already captures the new behaviour that the project expects.  

Required functional behaviour
-----------------------------
verifyPhase
• If `pendingBlocks` is empty **and** `blocksAppliedWithoutBuild` is 0 → immediately return  
  `new Step.Fatal(TaskResult.StopReason.SUCCESS)`.

• If `blocksAppliedWithoutBuild` > 0 and the verification command is missing/blank **or** the build
  succeeds → call `reportComplete("Success!" /* or similar final message */)` and return  
  `new Step.Fatal(TaskResult.StopReason.SUCCESS)`.

• If the build fails → create a new `LoopContext` with a `UserMessage` describing the failure and
  return `new Step.Retry(...)`.

Existing behaviour for interruption and read-only edit handling must stay unchanged, but now use the
`report` / `reportComplete` helpers for console output.

Modify the finite state machine as needed to achieve this and make the tests pass.
