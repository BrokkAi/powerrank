### Problem

When a CQL query cannot be satisfied because a secondary index is *still building*, clients should
receive `INDEX_BUILD_IN_PROGRESS` instead of the generic `INDEX_NOT_AVAILABLE`.
The code-base currently lacks this distinction and a number of unit and distributed tests that rely
on it are now failing.

Your task is to introduce the new failure reason and make sure it is:

1. Exposed through the public `RequestFailureReason` enumeration (with its own numeric code);
2. Raised on the coordinator (read & read-repair paths) when a replica refuses a query because the
   requested index is in the **building** state, both locally and remotely;
3. Correctly serialized / deserialized on the wire and mapped back to the new enum value;
4. Returned by `RequestFailureReason.forException(Throwable)` whenever the new
   `IndexBuildInProgressException` is thrown, and by extension propagated to clients;
5. Handled in the replica filtering logic so that a coordinator can distinguish between
   `INDEX_BUILD_IN_PROGRESS` and `INDEX_NOT_AVAILABLE` when it decides whether to fail a request.

All previously supported behaviour must remain unchanged.

### Acceptance criteria

The implementation is considered correct when **all** supplied unit and integration tests
(`ant test` and `ant testall`) succeed.  In particular:

* Existing tests that used to expect `INDEX_NOT_AVAILABLE` must still pass untouched.
* The new and modified tests now expect `INDEX_BUILD_IN_PROGRESS` under the right conditions.
* No regression is introduced in the request failure-reason wire protocol.

### Notes

* A new unchecked exception type is required; it must carry the new
  `RequestFailureReason` value so that the generic exception handling code continues to work.
* The numeric code chosen for `INDEX_BUILD_IN_PROGRESS` must not clash with any value that already
  exists in the **upstream Apache Cassandra** enumeration.
* Remember to update every bidirectional mapping (code ⇆ enum ⇆ exception) as well as the on-wire
  serializer.
* The coordinator must emit `ReadFailureException` whose per-endpoint failure map differentiates
  the two index-related reasons, depending on the replica’s index status.
* Cosmetic changes in log or exception messages are irrelevant, but message *content* visible to
  the new tests must match their expectations.

Implement the missing pieces so that the whole test suite passes.
