Implement support for OpenSSH host certificates in JGit’s Apache-SSHD based server-key database.

Behaviour to add

1. Known-hosts syntax  
   Lines that start with the marker “@cert-authority” declare a CA key that may sign host certificates.  
   • While processing a host certificate only entries that carry this marker are relevant.  
   • While processing a normal (non-certificate) host key these lines must be ignored – they neither authorise nor modify the result of the search.  
   • Lines that are both “@cert-authority” and “@revoked” revoke every certificate signed with that CA.

2. lookup(…)  
   This method is only used to reorder the SSH signature proposal.  
   It must return host keys, never CA keys, therefore every “@cert-authority” line has to be skipped.

3. accept(…)  
   • If the server transports a regular public key the current behaviour is unchanged – the key is looked up only in non-CA, non-revoked entries.  
   • If the server transports an OpenSshCertificate
     – Extract the certificate’s CA public key.  
     – Look that key up only in non-revoked “@cert-authority” entries that match one of the candidate host names / ports.  
     – Succeed when such an entry is found and fail otherwise.  
     – A failure must be final: do not prompt the user, do not add anything to known_hosts, return false immediately.

4. Revocation handling  
   When a matching entry is flagged “@revoked” raise the existing RevokedKeyException.  
   The user facing message must differentiate between a revoked certificate (“knownHostsRevokedCertificateMsg”) and a revoked plain key (“knownHostsRevokedKeyMsg”).

5. File modifications  
   “@cert-authority” lines can never be written automatically.  The database must not propose to add them and must not modify the known_hosts files when dealing with host certificates.

Constraints

• Only org.eclipse.jgit.internal.transport.sshd.OpenSshServerKeyDatabase and its resources are subject to change; all unit tests in org.eclipse.jgit.ssh.apache.test must pass.  
• Implementation must rely on Apache-SSHD’s OpenSshCertificate class that is already on the classpath.
