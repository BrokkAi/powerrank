Context  
The Ford-Fulkerson based optimisation that RangeStreamer sometimes uses to pick the “best” streaming
sources can be extremely slow on large or highly-vnoded clusters.  Operators want to be able to disable
that optimisation at runtime without having to change any code.

Your task  
1. Introduce a new system property called  
   cassandra.skip_optimal_streaming_candidates_calculation  
   – It must be handled through CassandraRelevantProperties.  
   – The property is boolean and must default to false.

2. When the flag is true RangeStreamer must **not** try to build the “optimised work map”.  
   In the current code that means the path that normally calls getOptimizedWorkMap(…) has to be
   skipped and the simpler convertPreferredEndpointsToWorkMap(…) has to be used instead.  
   The property is evaluated once for every call, so tests can flip its value in the same JVM.

3. All existing behaviour must stay unchanged when the flag is absent or set to “false”.  
   Strict-source bootstraps, RF==1 keyspaces and keyspaces with transient replicas must still bypass
   the optimisation exactly as they do today.

4. The new property must be reset-able via CassandraRelevantProperties so tests (and users) can switch
   it on and off in the same process.

Passing criteria  
All unit tests – the ones that were already in the tree and the new ones introduced with this change –
must succeed with the default flag value and with the flag toggled to true.
