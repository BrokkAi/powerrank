### Goal

Extend Cassandra so that users can ask **how fast compaction is running right now** as well as which
throughput cap is configured.  
All existing behaviour must stay unchanged and the new unit-tests devoted to
`getcompactionthroughput` and `setcompactionthroughput` must succeed.

### Required behaviour

1. **Continuous measurement**
   • While a compaction is running the number of bytes that are actually
   processed has to be recorded in a `Meter` called  
   `BytesCompactedThroughput` that lives under the `Compaction` metric
   registry.  
   • `CompactionManager` must update this meter every time it rate-limits a
   compaction task and must publish the meter through
   `CompactionManagerMBean` (method `getCompactionThroughput()`).

2. **JMX exposure**
   • `StorageServiceMBean` must expose  
     `Map<String,String> getCurrentCompactionThroughputMebibytesPerSec()`  
     returning three entries named `1minute`, `5minute`, `15minute`.  
   • Every value is the corresponding rate (MiB/s) of the meter above,
     formatted with three decimal digits.

3. **nodetool**
   • `nodetool getcompactionthroughput` keeps printing the configured cap
     (MiB/s) and, beneath it, the three current figures exactly as specified:
     ```
     Current compaction throughput: <cap> MiB/s
     Current compaction throughput (1 minute):  <rate> MiB/s
     Current compaction throughput (5 minute):  <rate> MiB/s
     Current compaction throughput (15 minute): <rate> MiB/s
     ```
     Spelling, blanks and units must match.

4. **Input validation**
   • `nodetool setcompactionthroughput <int>` continues to accept only an
     integer between 0 and `Integer.MAX_VALUE-1` MiB/s and prints the same
     error messages that were previously expected by the tests.

### Constraints

• Do **not** change any public method signatures other than the ones explicitly
  mentioned above.  
• Do **not** alter existing output unless specified.  
• Make sure the new functionality is thread-safe and inexpensive.

When all requirements are met, the complete test-suite (old and new) executes
successfully.
