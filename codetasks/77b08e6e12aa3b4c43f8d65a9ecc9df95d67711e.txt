The recent test-suite expects several small but incompatible API changes that are missing in the current codebase.  
Update the implementation so that every module compiles and the new tests pass.

Key requirements

1. Lazy default helper  
   dev.langchain4j.internal.Utils now needs an additional overload

   <T> T getOrDefault(T value, java.util.function.Supplier<T> defaultSupplier)

   – return `value` if it is not null, otherwise evaluate and return `defaultSupplier.get()`.  
   Existing overloads must stay untouched.

2. Streaming fixes  
   In dev.langchain4j.model.ollama.OllamaClient the SSE listener must forward a chunk to  
   `handler.onPartialResponse(...)` only when the chunk’s text is not null/empty.

3. Ollama builders / request objects  
   • Correct the exception text in OllamaBaseChatModel (cannot use both *format* and *responseFormat*).  
   • Replace the `keepAlive` field type from `Long` to `Integer` everywhere it appears  
     (OllamaChatRequest, its Builder and OllamaChatRequestParameters + builder).  
   • Builder’s `numPredict(Integer)` continues to delegate to the common
     `maxOutputTokens` property.  
   • When a builder overrides with another
     OllamaChatRequestParameters instance, copy the `repeatPenalty` field, not
     `frequencyPenalty`.

4. Code style cleanup  
   Apply the tiny spelling corrections already reflected in the tests
   (“supported” instead of “suppoerted”, “Can’t” instead of “CanB”, etc.).

No other behavioural changes are required.  Compile the project and ensure that **all tests succeed**.
