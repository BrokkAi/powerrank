Context  
JGit decides whether repository files (loose objects, pack directory, packed-refs file, loose refs …​) may be considered “unchanged” simply by comparing their file-system attributes (size, mtime, inode, …​).  This is fast, but on some file systems—especially NFS—those attributes are not always up-to-date.  In the past JGit offered several unrelated configuration keys to disable that optimisation:

• core.trustFolderStat (boolean) – very coarse switch  
• core.trustPackedRefsStat – dedicated to the packed-refs file  
• core.trustLooseRefStat  – dedicated to loose ref files  

The project now consolidates and generalises those keys.

Task  
Add first-class support for the new option core.trustStat and the new enum org.eclipse.jgit.lib.CoreConfig.TrustStat.  Refactor the code that examines repository files so it uses the new enum instead of the previous booleans/enums, and make the old keys remain functional (but deprecated).

Functional requirements

1. New enum  
   CoreConfig.TrustStat must contain the values  
     • NEVER  
     • ALWAYS  
     • AFTER_OPEN – use the attributes, but only after the file or directory has been opened/closed once to refresh NFS caches  
     • INHERIT    – only meaningful while parsing; no caller should ever see it

2. Configuration semantics  
   a. core.trustStat is global. Default: ALWAYS.  
   b. core.trustFolderStat is still recognised.  
      – If core.trustStat is absent, translate true→ALWAYS, false→NEVER and log a warning.  
      – If both are set, core.trustStat wins and a warning is logged.  
   c. The file-specific keys  
        core.trustPackedRefsStat  
        core.trustLooseRefStat  
        core.trustPackStat               (NEW)  
        core.trustLooseObjectStat        (NEW)  
      accept the same value set as core.trustStat.  
      Their default is INHERIT, meaning “use the global value”.  
   d. The legacy enums TrustPackedRefsStat and TrustLooseRefStat stay in the public API but are now deprecated.  Internally they are mapped to TrustStat.

3. Behavioural changes  
   Wherever JGit previously used  
        boolean trustFolderStat  
        TrustPackedRefsStat  
        TrustLooseRefStat  
   switch to the new TrustStat coming from CoreConfig.  The effective behaviour must be

      NEVER        – ignore attributes and always re-scan/read  
      ALWAYS       – current behaviour when the old boolean/enums were ‘true’  
      AFTER_OPEN   – before trusting attributes, open+close the relevant file or
                     directory (for loose objects: the 2-hex fan-out dir; for pack
                     files: the objects/pack directory; for refs: parent dirs up
                     to repo root, exactly as old AFTER_OPEN option did)  
      INHERIT      – must have been resolved during config parsing; treat it as
                     an illegal state if encountered at runtime.

4. Logging & messages  
   Two new warning texts must be available via JGitText.properties  
        deprecatedTrustFolderStat  
        precedenceTrustConfig  
   One further message is required for the illegal use of INHERIT  
        invalidTrustStat  

5. Public API additions  
   CoreConfig gets  
        getTrustPackedRefsStat()  
        getTrustLooseRefStat()  
        getTrustPackStat()  
        getTrustLooseObjectStat()  
   returning TrustStat.

6. Affected subsystems  
   The implementation must update at least  
        org.eclipse.jgit.internal.storage.file.LooseObjects  
        org.eclipse.jgit.internal.storage.file.PackDirectory  
        org.eclipse.jgit.internal.storage.file.RefDirectory  
   so their logic obeys the new enum and options.

7. Tests  
   All existing unit tests (old and newly introduced) must pass without modification.

Your solution must compile with Java 8 (the project’s baseline) and respect existing coding standards.
