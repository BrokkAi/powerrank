### Problem

`org.eclipse.jgit.internal.storage.file.Pack` can already lazily open the
`.idx`, `.rev` and bitmap index files that belong to a pack file.
For some use-cases, callers also need quick access to the *object size
index* (`*.osi`, extension constant `PackExt.OBJECT_SIZE_INDEX`) that is
optionally created by `PackWriter.writeObjectSizeIndex(...)`.

Add support for this index to `Pack` so that callers can

* check whether a pack has an object-size index,
* query how many objects are covered by the index and
* obtain the size of a specific object **without** having to read the
  object itself.

All existing functionality must keep working and all supplied tests –
including the new ones – must pass.



#### Required behaviour

1. `Pack` must load the `*.osi` file on demand and cache the result.
   * Use `PackObjectSizeIndexLoader.load(InputStream)` to read it.
   * Don’t try to load the file more than once; remember a failed attempt.
   * Be thread-safe (same level of safety as the current `.idx` handling).

2. Public API additions in `Pack`

   ```
   boolean hasObjectSizeIndex()           // true if the .osi file exists
   long    getObjectSizeIndexCount()      // number of entries, or 0 if none
   long    getIndexedObjectSize(AnyObjectId objectId)
   ```

   * `getIndexedObjectSize(...)`  
     – Caller *must* only invoke this when `hasObjectSizeIndex()` is true  
     – Return the object’s size taken from the index  
     – Return **-1** if the object is not present in the index  
     – Throw `IllegalStateException` if the pack has no object-size index.

3. Loading logic is similar to the one already used for the reverse
   index:
   * store the loaded `PackObjectSizeIndex` in a volatile field,
   * guard the actual loading with `synchronized(this)`,
   * if the file is missing, set a flag so later calls immediately know
     there is nothing to load.

4. `TestRepository.packAndPrune()` already writes the `*.osi` file when
   `PackConfig.getMinBytesForObjSizeIndex() >= 0`; the implementation
   must work with that.

No other behavioural changes are expected.
