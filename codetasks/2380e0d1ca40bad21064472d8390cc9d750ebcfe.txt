Task summary  
A number of classes were updated to rely on a new helper that has not existed so far:

org.apache.lucene.util.MathUtil#unsignedMin(int a, int b)

Your job is to add this method to MathUtil (and only touch files the harness tells you to).  
The method must:

1. Compare the two given values as 32-bit unsigned integers (i.e. the range 0 … 2³²-1, so negative signed ints are larger than every non-negative signed int).
2. Return whichever of the two arguments is the smaller one in that unsigned sense.
3. Run in constant time – just a couple of simple operations; no boxing or loops required.

After you implement it, every existing and newly added test—including the new cases in TestMathUtil—must compile and succeed. No other behaviour of MathUtil may change.
